# IOTA Cold Storage

This web-app generates IOTA addresses given a private seed and prints them onto a graphical paper wallet. Includes a seed generation tool which uses entropy collected from the user to further randomize a pseudo-random seed generated by javascript. However, it is highly recommended to only use the seed generator for testing/demonstrative purposes as seed generators are inherently insecure. Please take caution when using this tool.

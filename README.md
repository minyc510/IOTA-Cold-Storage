# IOTA Cold Storage

This web-app generates IOTA addresses given a private seed and prints them onto a graphical paper wallet. Includes a seed generation tool which uses entropy collected from the user to further randomize a pseudo-random seed generated by javascript. However, it is highly recommended to only use the seed generator for testing/demonstrative purposes as seed generators are inherently insecure. Please take caution when using this tool.

A live demo can be found here: [iota-cold-storage.surge.sh](http://iota-cold-storage.surge.sh/)

## Build and Compile Locally

Requires `node js`.
Use `node -v` to check if you have it installed.

    git clone https://github.com/minyc510/IOTA-Cold-Storage.git
    cd IOTA-Cold-Storage
    npm install
    npm start

## Tools Used
- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
- Front-end framework: [React-Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/).
- Image manipulation done using [React-Konva](https://github.com/lavrton/react-konva).
- Addresses generated using the official IOTA javascript API [iota.lib.js](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.lib.js).

## About IOTA 
IOTA is a cryptocurrency that does NOT utilize the blockchain to store transactions. Instead, IOTA uses "The Tangle" which is a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) where transactions are stored as nodes. 

As opposed to traditional blockchain currencies (eg Bitcoin) where transactions  are approved in blocks through mining, transactions in IOTA are approved by successive transactions. All transactions enter the tangle as nodes. Each new node approves two previous transactions. Therefore, each node will point to exactly two nodes in a non-cyclic fashion (hence a DAG). 

The Tangle allows IOTA to be sent without any fees whatsoever. However, the sender must perform proof of work operations to approve the two previous transactions.
